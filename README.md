# Salifort_Retention.
### Project Overview
#### This is the Capstone Project completed in Course 7 of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. This project is similar in nature to my previous project, Waxe Churn Prediciton project, in that a predicitive model is built. 
#### The goal of this project is to determine what facotrs contribute to employees leaving Salifort Motors. The project will cover the full data analysis life cycle (EDA, visualizations, model buidling, and deriving insights from the data). This project will build only ranodm forests models. Two random forest models will be built, one **without** an engineered field, and one **with** an engineered field. The results of these 2 models will then be compared.
